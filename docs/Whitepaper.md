### Abstract
Overview of the project

### Introduction

#### What is Atlantic Project?
Atlantic Project is a message building protocol, acting as a layer on top of Chainlink's upcoming Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), enabling the calling of functions and deployment of contracts across blockchains. The project is a backend service, enabling developers to focus on building the logic for their cross-chain dApps, rather than concerning themselves with the underlying infrastructure.

#### Why use Atlantic Project?
The protocol works to ensure that information is transferred between blockchains in the fastest and most gas efficient way possible. Similarly to how many organisations rely on cloud providers to provision on-demand computer system resources, dApps can rely on Atlantic to provide high quality cross-chain services. Benefits of relying on a third party service like Atlantic include:

•	Developer time – 

•	Standardization – 

•	Repitition – 

•	Gas efficient – 

•	Continual development – taking advantage of most recent technologies, continually improving
